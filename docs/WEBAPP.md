# Web App

AppAutoAction includes a bright-by-default local chat, artifact canvas, and preview workspace for 3D experiment design and paper figures. Use the top-bar theme button to switch to dark mode.

```bash
app-auto-action web --port 8787 --open
```

The app runs on `127.0.0.1` by default. If the requested port is busy, it chooses the next available port.

## Workflow

1. Chat to adjust the scene spec.
2. Generate an exact `NxM` SVG paper-figure grid from the canvas controls or chat.
3. Review artifacts in the canvas rail: SVG grids, AgInTi dry-run payloads, OpenSCAD files, Blender renders, `.blend` files, and scene specs.
4. Use Dry Run to validate Blender output paths.
5. Use Render to launch Blender headless.
6. Save backend settings for AgInTi image generation and BioRender MCP handoff.

The web app uses the same scene spec renderer documented in [SCENE_SPEC.md](SCENE_SPEC.md). It does not require API keys; chat edits are deterministic scene-spec mutations.
AgInTi image generation defaults to `--dry-run`, which writes a redacted prompt, request payload, and manifest without calling an image provider.
The editable figure direction is documented in [EDITABLE_FIGURE_PIPELINE.md](EDITABLE_FIGURE_PIPELINE.md): use generated images for overview concepts, keep atomic editable parts, assemble final paper figures with TeX clipping/layering, and expose both overview and editable views in the canvas.
The matching terminal workflow is documented in [STUDIO_CLI.md](STUDIO_CLI.md). CLI and web actions share the same artifact manifest and backend helpers.

## Backends

- AgInTi: configured through command, workspace, provider, model, image size, and dry-run settings. Default command: `aginti image --json --dry-run`.
- BioRender: configured with the official MCP URL `https://mcp.services.biorender.com/mcp` and an auth environment variable name. The app does not store BioRender secrets.
- OpenSCAD: exports the current scene spec to a simplified `.scad` mechanical-layout proxy.
- Blender: renders the scene spec to PNG and `.blend` artifacts.
- TeX: planned assembly layer for clipping, labels, callouts, and final paper-safe exports.
- Target registry: the CLI still routes configured targets such as Blender, BioRender, Unity, and Unreal through `agenticapp.targets.json`.

The Backends panel exposes toolchain toggles for Blender, OpenSCAD, AgInTi image generation, BioRender MCP, and the target registry. Toggles are saved as non-secret settings and are intended as routing controls for future workflows; current button actions still run their matching local workflow directly.
The target dispatch box lists configured AppAutoAction targets and defaults to dry-run. Use it to test Blender, BioRender, Unity, Unreal, or custom targets from `agenticapp.targets.json`; each dispatch result is saved as a JSON artifact in the canvas.

## API

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Static web app. |
| `GET /api/spec` | Load the default scene spec and preview image. |
| `GET /api/settings` | Load backend settings and detected status. |
| `POST /api/settings` | Save non-secret backend settings under `output/webapp/settings.json`. |
| `GET /api/artifacts` | List the project-local artifact manifest. |
| `GET /api/targets` | List configured target-registry entries. |
| `POST /api/chat` | Apply a chat instruction to the current scene spec. |
| `POST /api/dispatch` | Dry-run or send an instruction to a configured target and register the result artifact. |
| `POST /api/figure-grid` | Generate an exact SVG paper-figure grid and AgInTi image dry-run payloads. |
| `POST /api/openscad-export` | Export the current scene spec as OpenSCAD. |
| `POST /api/plan` | Validate and return a dry-run render plan. |
| `POST /api/render` | Render the current scene spec with Blender. |
| `GET /artifacts/...` | Serve generated SVG, PNG, `.blend`, `.scad`, text, and JSON artifacts. |

Generated files are written under `output/webapp/`.

## CLI Parity

The following terminal commands mirror the web app:

```bash
app-auto-action studio status
app-auto-action studio figure-grid "optical device icons 2x3" --rows 2 --cols 3
app-auto-action studio openscad examples/paper-optics-setup.scene.json
app-auto-action studio dispatch blender "Prepare an editable paper figure setup"
app-auto-action webapp start --port 19473
```
