# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

AppAutoAction is a small Python CLI and web package. Production code lives in `src/agenticapp/`: `cli.py` handles commands, `config.py` loads target registries, `adapters.py` dispatches instructions, `webapp.py` serves the local studio, `artifacts.py` tracks generated files, `paper_figures.py` builds SVG grids, `openscad_export.py` writes CAD proxies, and `backends.py` stores AgInTi/BioRender settings. Tests live in `tests/`. Static web assets live in `src/agenticapp/web/static/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m agenticapp list`: list configured Blender, BioRender, Unity, and Unreal targets.
- `app-auto-action list`: run the installed console command.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m agenticapp doctor`: validate target configuration without sending commands.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m agenticapp dispatch blender "Create a cube" --dry-run`: inspect the JSON envelope for a target.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m agenticapp mcp-config`: emit MCP client configuration.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m agenticapp scene-template experiment-setup`: print a reusable 3D experiment scene spec.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m agenticapp render-scene examples/paper-optics-setup.scene.json --dry-run`: validate a scene spec and output paths.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m agenticapp web --port 8787`: start the local chat, canvas, and preview web app.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests`: run the full test suite.
- `scripts/install_blender_portable.sh`: install a no-sudo Blender binary under `~/.local/share/appautoaction/blender`.
- `app-auto-action --config configs/blender-local-command.example.json dispatch blender "Draw a building"`: run the local Blender bridge.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Python 3.10+ and the standard library unless a dependency clearly improves the project. Follow PEP 8 with 4-space indentation. Use `snake_case` for modules, functions, and variables; use `PascalCase` for dataclasses and exceptions. Keep CLI output stable because tests and downstream scripts may parse it.

## Testing Guidelines

Use `unittest` for now. Name test files `test_*.py` and keep tests focused on behavior: config validation, dispatch envelope shape, transport behavior, and CLI return codes. Add regression tests when changing adapter semantics or target config parsing.
For scene rendering, test JSON validation and dry-run plans without requiring Blender; use a manual render check when changing `src/agenticapp/blender/scene_renderer.py`.
For web changes, keep tests focused on API behavior, artifact registration, and static startup; manually verify the browser layout with the local server.

## Figure Pipeline Rules

Paper figure generation must stay editable and atomic. Do not treat a generated bitmap as the final source of truth. Use image generation for overview concepts, then split figures into named parts with their own prompts, source files, tool settings, previews, and edit history. Prefer BioRender for academic assets, OpenSCAD for device geometry, Blender for rendered setups, and TeX for clipping and final assembly. Preserve part IDs and rebuild exports from manifests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use concise imperative commit messages, such as `Add Unity target validation` or `Document BioRender MCP setup`. Pull requests should include a summary, testing performed, linked issues when applicable, and screenshots only for UI-facing changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit `agenticapp.targets.json`, `.aginti/.env`, or generated `output/` files; they may contain local endpoints, tokens, or bulky artifacts. Keep secrets in environment variables such as `BIORENDER_API_KEY`. Treat editor bridges as privileged automation surfaces: review dry-run payloads before enabling live dispatch.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

Before editing, inspect `git status` and preserve unrelated local changes. Prefer repository commands from this file over generic assumptions, and update `README.md` plus this guide whenever CLI behavior or target configuration changes.
